This repo contains the source code for the root-domain `victorwesterlund.com`.

While some sub-domains host code which isn't open source, here's at least an explanation on what they're used for:

Domain name|Description
--|--
`public.victorwesterlund.com`|GCS bucket with public content *(the beautiful screenshot above)*
`*.github.victorwesterlun.com`|CNAME for my public repositories using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
`api.victorwesterlund.com`|Hosted endpoints (most of which contain the back-end component of my public repos)
`friday.victorwesterlund.com`|Self-hosted content
`info.victorwesterlund.com`|(old and useless) Google Pages site
